# Project Title

Simple overview of use/purpose.

Program to play a simple Mancala Game, and all of the games functionalities given a Object Oriented Design.

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

There are 11 executable classes, and all the testing classes. 10 of the classes come together as individual parts of the full game and are used on the TextUI. Including the junit tests you are able ensure smaller parts of the program work well, and reducing the difficulty of testing a large amount of code. The textUI is what actually uses the MancalaGame which uses the Board class to make the game work. The textUI is an attempt at a more object oriented designed textUI.
